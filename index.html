                In a country like India thousands of students graduate every year. But even though they have the degree
                most of them do not meet the criteria for working in a company. Many companies waste a ton of resources
                trying to select the students with necessary technical skills. This is where SPI comes in.
                <br>
                SPI aims to estabilish a rating system based on ones technical skills to help them get their dream job
                as well as help companies get their dream employees. We aim to provide a detailed summary of a students
                techical skills which will be calculated using our <strong>Skill Proficiency Index</strong> to the
                companies which will help them choose a suitable employee from the large pool of
                students appearing for job interviews every year.

                            SPI rating would really be helpful for students from not so elite colleges like
                            IITs/BITS/NITs to offer their deserving students the same opportunity as them.
                            <br>
                            It would be of immense help to students who do not have any official degree from a college
                            or are self schooled as due to the IIT culture in India many employers tend to overlook
                            them.
